CSS

As you progress through the world of CSS it can be easy to get overwhelmed with everything you learn along the way. As such, it can be a good idea to take a moment to refresh yourself on that information. Especially the basics, as they help hold your design work together on that HTML page. CSS lets you customize your color and fonts of your html page, it can be easy to go through the motions of learning certain aspects of a skill, yet still, outright forget what a term means. The following collection of terms are ones that are important to CSS and sometimes the ones that seem to slip away the most.
These small points can make a huge impact on how you design your work. Whether keeping the work clean or ensuring older styles are not indirectly cleared, the effectiveness can be felt as the CSS designer grows in skill (and tools). However, one very important thing to remember when working with CSS is to keep it interesting. When you reach out to learn new techniques or properties to work with, it should be towards a goal of your own. Learning these tools is much more enjoyable when you are able to play with them to see how your own design views are impacted. Enjoy the process of learning, including the failures. Knowing how not to do something is just as important as nailing it.
