  <title>My Greatest Childhood &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt; One of my Amazing Childhoods &lt;/h1&gt; &lt;img src="https://static-asset-delivery.hasbroapps.com/a9e79c9b34ea183cad07eb995c5f51818b6c9447/0465731939d703d10b45538ff8e0efbb.png" /&gt; &lt;p align="center"&gt;If you're a fan of 80's cartoons then Transformers is by far one of the best cartoons you'll ever enjoy next to Thundercats, G.I. Joe, Masters of the Universe and so many awesome cartoons from that era. Despite how old school the animation looks by today standards and some of the animation errors that's very easy to spot I'll take watching the original Transformers series over those Michael Bay movies any day. Plus if you saw the Bumblebee movie then you're bound to really enjoy this cartoon series even more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</title>
